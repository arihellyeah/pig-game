## This is a simple javascript game that I built as a part of my Udemy course work for 'The Complete JavaScript Course'.
# Description
Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.
# Setup/Installation Requirements
The application is super basic. Simply clone and launch the index.html file :-)
If you need to use your own custom styles you can define them within the css/styles.css file.
Feel free to toy around with the functionality and, if you come up with something particularly clever, feel free to send a pull request! Enjoy!!
